This package is under active development. This manual was created in February 2021 for version number 0.\+34. \hypertarget{index_System}{}\subsection{Requirements}\label{index_System}
In its current form, the package has been shown to work on Windows 10, Linux Ubuntu, Raspbian OS and mac\+OS Mojave 10.\+14.\+4. Compilers, such as the Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler, G\+C\+C11 and Clang were tested. The compiler must support at least C++ 2011, but a C++ 2017 compatible compiler is recommended for some examples. For help and more contact us at github.\+com/devanshr/\+Epidemics
